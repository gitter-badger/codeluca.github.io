    <strong>Young Rewired State Best Example of Design Winner / Language: Node.js and Java / APIS: Yelp, Google Matrix, Google Maps, Google Places, OpenWeatherAPI, More...</strong>
      <br>
Ever been in a situation where you just want to see a city without having to use guidebooks and looking up places to go? With Tourify you are able to create a custom tour just for you. You can customise your tour or just get a tour from where you are on the spot. Guide books don't have user reviews and trip advisor tours are static and you can't affect it. This is the perfect app for people who are travelling. It has a simplistic interface that include fullscreen pictures of the locations you are going to as well as information about them.<br>
      We created this app for Young Rewired State, and did very well. It was an awesome project.<br>
